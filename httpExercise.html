	<h1>Introduction to HTTP and Security</h1><br><br>

	<h3>1.What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?</h3>
	<p><b>ANS: </b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes.</p>

	<h3>2.Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?</h3>
	<p><b>ANS: </b>HTTP is called as a stateless protocol because each request is executed independently, without any knowledge of the requests that were executed before it, which means once the transaction ends the connection between the browser and the server is also lost.</p>

	<h3>3.Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP</h3>
	<p><b>ANS: </b>In client-server protocols, like HTTP, sessions consist of three phases:</p>

	<p>Establishing a connection: In client-server protocols, it is the client which establishes the connection. Opening a connection in HTTP means initiating a connection in the underlying transport layer, usually this is TCP. With TCP the default port, for an HTTP server on a computer, is port 80. Other ports can also be used, like 8000 or 8080. The URL of a page to fetch contains both the domain name, and the port number, though the latter can be omitted if it is 80. See Identifying resources on the Web for more details.</p>

	<p>Sending a client request:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The first line contains a request method followed by its parameters: the path of the document, i.e. an absolute URL without the protocol or domain name, the HTTP protocol version</li>
			<li>Subsequent lines represent an HTTP header, giving the server information about what type of data is appropriate (e.g., what language, what MIME types), or other data altering its behavior (e.g., not sending an answer if it is already cached). These HTTP headers form a block which ends with an empty line.</li>
			<li>The final block is an optional data block, which may contain further data mainly used by the POST method.</li>
		</ul>

	<p>Structure of a server response:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The first line, the status line, consists of an acknowledgment of the HTTP version used, followed by a status request (and its brief meaning in human-readable text).</li>
			<li>Subsequent lines represent specific HTTP headers, giving the client information about the data sent (e.g. type, data size, compression algorithm used, hints about caching). Similarly to the block of HTTP headers for a client request, these HTTP headers form a block ending with an empty line.</li>
			<li>The final block is a data block, which contains the optional data.</li>
		</ul>	


	<h3>4.Describe the parameters on a get and post request.</h3>
	<p><b>ANS: </b>GET method is used to appends form data to the URL in name or value pair. If you use GET, the length of URL will remain limited. It helps users to submit the bookmark the result.</p>
	<p>POST is a method that is supported by HTTP and depicts that a web server accepts the data included in the body of the message. POST is often used by World Wide Web to send user generated data to the web server or when you upload file.</p>
	<p>Both GET and POST method is used to transfer data from client to server in HTTP protocol but Main difference between POST and GET method is that GET carries request parameter appended in URL string while POST carries request parameter in message body which makes it more secure way of transferring data from client to server in http protocol.</p>

	<h3>5.What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?</h3>
	<p><b>ANS: </b>HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.</p>

	<p>A 200-level response means that everything is working exactly as it should. 200: “Everything is OK.” This is the code that is delivered when a web page or resource acts exactly the way it's expected to. 201: “Created.” The server has fulfilled the browser's request, and as a result, has created a new resource.</p>

	<p>The HTTP 404, 404 Not Found, 404, 404 Error, Page Not Found or File Not Found error message is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) standard response code, in computer network communications, to indicate that the browser was able to communicate with a given server, but the server could not find what was requested.</p>

	<h3>6.What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</h3>
	<p><b>ANS: </b>An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the same server.  For example, users can place items in a shopping cart, switch to another page or even another site, and when they come back, the site recognizes them and the current state of the cart. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.</p>

	<h3>7.Why are cookies a security issue?</h3>
	<p><b>ANS: </b>Since the data in cookies doesn't change, cookies themselves aren't harmful. They can't infect computers with viruses or other malware. However, some cyberattacks can hijack cookies and enable access to your browsing sessions. The danger lies in their ability to track individuals' browsing histories.</p>	

	<h3>8.Describe session hijacking and XSS.</h3>
	<p><b>ANS: </b>Session hijacking, sometimes also known as cookie hijacking is the exploitation of a valid computer session—sometimes also called a session key—to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system.</p>	

	<p>XSS or Cross-site Scripting is probably the most dangerous and widespread method of web session hijacking. By exploiting server or application vulnerabilities, attackers can inject client-side scripts (typically JavaScript) into web pages, causing your browser to execute arbitrary code when it loads a compromised page. If the server doesn’t set the HttpOnly attribute in session cookies, injected scripts can gain access to your session key, providing attackers with the necessary information for session hijacking.</p>	

	<h3>9.Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF).</h3>
	<p><b>ANS: </b>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing.</p>	

	<p>If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.</p>

	<h3>10.What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?</h3>
	<p><b>ANS: </b>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a “preflight” request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.</p>

	<p>This cross-origin sharing standard can enable cross-site HTTP requests for: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Invocations of the XMLHttpRequest or Fetch APIs, as discussed above.</li>
			<li>Web Fonts (for cross-domain font usage in @font-face within CSS), so that servers can deploy TrueType fonts that can only be cross-site loaded and used by web sites that are permitted to do so.</li>
			<li>WebGL textures.</li>
			<li>Images/video frames drawn to a canvas using drawImage().</li>
			<li>CSS Shapes from images.</li>
		</ul>
